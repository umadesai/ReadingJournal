    "In today's reading, you'll be exploring TurtleWorld!\n",
    "TurtleWorld is part of the [swampy](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/) package, written by Allen Downey.\n",
    "As part of the [Get Set](https://sites.google.com/site/sd16spring/home/assignments-and-mini-projects/setup-your-environment) assignment, you installed the swampy package using the pip Python package management tool. If you somehow missed that step or you see errors when you try to import TurtleWorld, you can install swampy by running:\n",

    "### Turtle wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always run your code as separate Python scripts, but here are a few tips for mixing TurtleWorld with Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    " - TurtleWorld will appear in a new GUI window, rather than inline in the notebook like typical results do\n",
    " - You will not be able to close the TurtleWorld window unless you run `wait_for_user()` as the last line of your code.\n",
    " - Jupyter notebook works like one big Python script, even though it is broken up into sections. This means that you could create a Turtle in one cell, move it in a later cell, and then `wait_for_user()` in yet another. Despite this, it might be easier to treat each cell in this assignment as a separate script, creating a new world at the beginning and destroying it at the end of each."

If this simple test doesn't work, check your swampy install (especially if you get an `ImportError`) and ask for help."
